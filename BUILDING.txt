Building the YajHFC FOP Plugin from source
==========================================

1. Required software packages
-----------------------------

You will need to have the following software packages installed to build YajHFC:

- A Java JDK, version >= 1.5.0 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads)
- Apache Ant, version >= 1.7.0 (http://ant.apache.org/)
- The Apache FOP framework, version >= 0.95beta (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/)
- YajHFC itself, as JAR archive

If you want to build from CVS or modify translations, you will also need:
- GNU gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)

2. Build instructions
---------------------

To build the YajHFC plugin, go to the source directory (the directory where build.xml
and this file reside in) and perform the following steps:

i)
Edit the file build.properties to specify the location of the Apache FOP framework
and the YajHFC JAR file.

ii)
Invoke the following command:

ant dist

This compiles the YajHFC plugin, creates the JAR file build/FOPPlugin.jar and
the distribution build/FOPPlugin.zip.

That file can be used just like the ZIP file downloaded from the YajHFC homepage.

NOTES:
~~~~~~

Currently building the translations only works on a Unix-like system
because a shell script is used in the build process (i18n/fmtall.sh). 
Creating Windows batch (or VBS/JScript) files with the same functionality
should be possible, however.
Please also note that this is only a problem if you want to build from CVS
(or modify translations) as the source archive contains precompiled
translations.
